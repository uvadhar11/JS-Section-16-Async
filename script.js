/*
// ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT, AJAX, AND APIS
// synchronous code: code executed line by line in the defined order of execution (execution thread is a part of the execution context in the computer's cpu that executes this code). Can cause problems when one line of code takes a long time (like alert which blocks the code and only goes when we click ok).
// asynchronous: setTimeout is async since runs in the background and doesn't block the execution thread. Non-blocking code.
// Callbacks don't automatically make code async - some do and some don't. (like map doesn't, setTimeout does)
// setting the src attribute of an image is async since loading images takes time (there is a load event that is fired once its done loading) - the callback function runs once the load event is fired (defered an action into the future, making the code async and non-blocking).
// event listeners alone don't make code async like callbacks. Event listener listening for a click isn't doing anything in the background so not async. The load event waiting is async because the image is loading in the background then the callback function runs. Since things are happening in the background, this is async.
// AJAX - async JS and XML which allows us to communicate with remote web servers in a remote way - we can request data from web servers dynamically.
// if we want data from browser (client), we send http request to web server (different types - get request is a request to get data, post request is sending data to the server, etc). Then server sends a response with the data back. When asking for data, the server ussually has a web api (has the data we are asking for)
// API - Application Programming Interface. Software that can be used by another piece of software to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information. True in all programming. Some examples are DOM api, geolocation api, etc. Other software (like our applications can interact with these self contained apis) - we can also make our own class api (and make some methods like our public interface - classes can fit this api description).
// "Online" API - application running on a server that recieves data requests and sends data back as a response. Also known as just API or web API, etc.
// we can build our own web APIs but we need back end development for that like with node.js or we can use 3rd part APIs
// data formats: XML (used to be widely used to transmit data on web but not many APIs use it anymore) - use term ajax since popular back in day, JSON data format (very popular - JS object but converted into a string)

// OUR FIRST AJAX CALL: XMLHttpRequest
// in JS there are multiple ways to do AJAX calls but we are going to do the most old school one
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // might need this in the future even though it is old
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`); // args: request type (like get request is to get data), next one is the api endpoint or api link
  // CORS: cross origin resource sharing (need this to be unknown or yes so we can access it with our own code), auth means needs authentication (like api key), and some use https and others don't, etc.
  // api endpoints: name for the url of the api
  request.send(); // send the request and it fetches the data in the background and once we get it, the load event is fired. Can't store this in a variable since the data doesn't exist yet since its ASYNC so we need to wait for a result
  // console.log(request.responseText); // doesn't print anything since data doesn't exist yet

  // async since waiting for something to load (api call to come back)
  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    //   console.log(this.responseText); // this refers to the request the event listener is on

    // we got JSON back so let's convert to a JS object
    const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText); // this is an object inside an array so we are just destructuring it (we could have also just added .data at the end of the parse but destructuring is cleaner)
    console.log(data);

// if we wanna make the requests in an order, we can chain the requests so one happens after the other, etc.

// HOW THE WEB WORKS: REQUESTS AND RESPONSES
// client sends req to web server and sends a response back to the client (called the Request-response model or the client-server architecture)
// web server: gets a protocol (http or https), then a domain name like restcountries.com and then the resource you are trying to access is the url. Need to convert doamin name to real server address since the domain name is not the actual one (its easy to know) so we have a server called DNS - domain name server that matches the url to the actual address (happens thru ur internet service provider) -> so first a DNS lookup happens and gets sent back to the client. Actual address has the protocol, IP address, then port number depending on the protocol. the resource is sent over in the http request
// STEP 1: DNS LOOKUP
// STEP 2: TCP/IP SOCKET CONNECTION between client and web server that is kept until all the files and stuff is transferred. Communication protocols (ip = internet protocol, tcp = transmission protocol which control how data is sent and communication and stuff)
// STEP 3: HTTP REQUEST - http = hypertext transfer protocol. Communication protocol which means a system of rules for 2 or more parties to communicate (like clients and servers - sending messages between them).
// start line: http method (like get, post (send), put, patch (put and patch are modify data)), request target (sending the resource we want to access, if it was a slash we would be accessing the website root), http version
// the next line is the http request header (many possibilities for stuff)
// next stuff is request body but ONLY when sending data to server like with post requests
// valuable to know what responses and http requests look like even tho we don't write it. https - is encrypted with TLS and SSL which is the difference between that and http but it basically works the same
// request is formed and sent to the web server (http request) which gets the data and sends it in a http response
// STEP 4: HTTP RESPONSE - start line: http version, status code (200=ok, 404=page not found, etc), status message based on status code, http response headers, reponse body (like could have JSON, etc)
// if accessing a webpage - we have many requests and responses since index.html is the first to be loaded and for every file there is a new request. This back and forth process is for every file (and there can be multiple requests at the same time). API is like one req/response
// tcp breaks requests down into packets and will reassemble the packets into data in the whole picture we want so the packets can take different internet routes to get to the client (so the data can be sent as fast as possible). IP ensures the data gets to where it needs to go by using IP addresses on each packet (routes the data)

// request2.send();

// how we do it now
const request = fetch('https://restcountries.com/v2/name/portugal'); // more options that we can add to fetch like an options object, but we only really need the api url for now
console.log(request);

// Promise: An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an async operation. Or like a container for a future value (like a response from the AJAX call)
// Benefits: don't have to rely on events or callbacks passed into async functions (since sometimes they can be very unreliable), we can chain promises thus escaping callback hell
// Promise Lifecycle:
// pending: befoe the future value is available -> async task to get data and stuff -> async task finished then its called SETTLED
// settled has 2 states: fulfilled (data is now available) vs. rejected (error occurred) -> we can handle these states in our code.
// promises only settle ONCE. -> you can't change the state of the promise
// consume a promise: when you already have a promise (have to build the promise first - like the fetch api building the promise for us). Most of the time we are consuming promises (this means to use a promise to get a result)


// CONSUMING PROMISES
// const request = fetch('https://restcountries.com/v2/name/portugal');

//       // to read the reponse we need to call the JSON method on it to read the reponse (the response is a readable stream)
//       return response.json(); // this json method is also an async method so it will return a new promise. So we are returning this promise out of the function then using another then method to handle that new promise

// ASYNC: BEHIND THE SCENES: THE EVENT LOOP
// JS Runtime in the browser: container with everything to execute JS code
// engine: heart of runtime: has heap (where obj stored in memory) and call stack where code executed. Only one thread of execution (no multitasking)
// web apis: apis given to engine but not part of JS language itself - like fetch, dom, timers, etc.
// callback queue: holds the ready to be executed callback functions from events -> event loop puts these into call stack to run it - event loop lets async stuff work
// concurrency model: how JS handles multiple tasks happening at the same time (Event loop is how JS does this)
// question: how can async code be executed non blocking if only one thread?
// async tasks run in the web apis - since they have dom, timers, fetch, etc. If an img was loading sync then it would load in call stack and block everything
// callback on image goes into web apis since once image loads that is what happens.
// each line goes in call stack and when done its gone
// data fetch gets put into web apis environment. And .then goes inside there too once we get the promise
// once an event is fired, the callback is put in the callback queue (tasks the call stack will have to complete) - goes to the end of the queue -> if you had a timer and other callbacks inside the queue then the timer duration would be off. Callback queue also has DOM events (not async but still use this queue) -> so when an event is fired it will wait for its turn.
// event loop - if stack is empty, it takes the first callback from queue to be executed (event loop tick is what happens each time this movement happens) - orchestration of JS runtime.
// JS language has no sense of time since all the async stuff happens in runtime (not in engine) and the event loop moves stuff.
// promises work in a slightly different way -> callbacks of promises have their own queue called mictrotasks queue (has prioerity over callback queue -> similar to callback queue) -> event loop after every event loop tick (after moving the callback from queue to call stack) will run EVERY promise callback (also called MICROTASKS) in the microtasks queue before continuing callback queue execution
// if a microtask adds a new microtask, then that new microtask will be executed first - meaning microtasks can starve the callback queue (usually never a problem but that could happen)
// if you had a click event the callback would be in web api environment and then one fired, it would be moved to callback queue
*/

// THE EVENT LOOP IN PRACTICE
console.log('Test start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);
Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 1').then(res => console.log(res)); // Promise.resolve allows us to create a promise that is immediately resolved with a success value that we pass in. We can handle this with a then method as well
Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 2').then(res => {
  // simulating a long time microtask (the promise is still resolved immediately) but the microtask might not. So this will show how the timer will be delayed.
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {}
  console.log(res);
});
console.log('Test end');
// any code that is synchornous (not in a callback), will execute first so the console logs will execute first. Promise and timer finish at the same time - since promise callbacks (microtasks) have priority (microtasks queue has priority) so the promise callback will run first instead of the timer.
// timer might run a little bit later depending on how long it takes for the promise to run - this means u can't do high precision things with javascrpt timers since these timers aren't really accurate hwne doing promises things.
